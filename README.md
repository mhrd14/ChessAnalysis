A close to heart project which gathered the interest of industry professionals. This project dwells into the game of chess and analyzes factors which influence a win or a loss or a draw. Which moves improve your probability of win and what is the desired sequence of steps professionals make which takes them one step closer to the game ending in their favour.  


Chess has been one of the most invested areas of AI in the past, since it is primarily a game of patterns, and ample information is contained within each game. 
Therefore, this study has been dedicated to understand the patterns in a game of chess and assess the techniques and moves leading a (white) player towards winning or losing, using various data analytics techniques. The data collected provides information on several key variables influencing the victory status like the player rating, moves, number of turns and opening moves, among many others. 

Using exploratory analysis insights such as the most frequently used move to checkmate the black king, the most used opening move that gives the highest probability of winning and opening move preferences of proficient players etc were derived. 

Associative analysis identified moves with high support and move pairs with considerable confidence and lift, and Sequence Discovery concurred with it by observing the winning sequence of moves. 

Finally, multinomial and binary logistic regression enabled deduction of the impact of a certain moveâ€™s frequency on the outcome of the game determined by the odds ratios.
